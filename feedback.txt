Hi Lea,

Let me just start by saying that I love your project! It's very user-friendly, 
it's clean and I love the aesthetics of the application.

- Make sure to delete unused lines of code and files, like console logs, test, 
default react files, imports that you've ended up not using ecc

- Your filing system works great, everything is clear and simple to navigate.

- In the latest version of express, fetch is included! so there is no need to use axios, 
you can convert your axios post requests to regular fetch requests.

- Same goes to bodyParser. It's included in express.

- For future reference and organization - Try putting your pages components inside a folder called "pages", 
and inside these parent components include your child 
components that are located in the "components" folder. 

Overall, I loved your project! Very well done and it is clear that you've put a lot of effort into it.
Good job!
